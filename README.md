# source-documents
Source documents for the info in our app.  All content is publicly accessable and belongs to its original creators.  This just aggregates the information in one easy place for the team.


# Links:

Here are the two main source sites of the cognitive aids/infographics are:
Safe Airway Society
https://asa.org.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/SAS-Covid-19-Infographics.pdf
Royal North Shore
https://www.rnsascar.com/covid-19

We have full approval from both of the above institutions to use their source documents under the condition the logo is visible at some point and that they are referenced in acknowledgements.The above sites can hopefully help with design in terms of source sizes and aspect ratios.

For the "donning" and "doffing" infographics, the docuemnt with highest quality images is in source docuements and titled
COVID_19 PPE Sequence Donning and Doffing QRG_26.03.2020.docx

Here is a good source for some of the other original (PDFs etc.)
